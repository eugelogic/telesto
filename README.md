# Telesto

Telesto is a website comprising all my notes :-O

I've built it because I didn't find it very efficient to manage (search & edit) my notes on my machine.

Telesto was built with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and [Atlas](https://github.com/indigotree/atlas), it is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and soon will feature [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), the super powerful search engine.
